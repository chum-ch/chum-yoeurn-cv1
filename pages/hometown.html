                    Ba Phnom was one of the first religious and cultural sites in Cambodia and may be considered a
                    birthplace of the Cambodian nation. It was founded in the 5th century and was used as a place of
                    pilgrimage for various kings until the 19th century. Human sacrifices were also reported to take
                    place here until the 19th century.
                    Despite its history there is little that remains at Ba Phnom. What remains is a modern wat, some
                    small pagodas, and the rebuilt ruins of Preah Vihear Chann, which was an 11th century temple. Most
                    of the temple was destroyed, so the rebuilt temple is mostly concrete with a corrugated roof, and
                    is the place where it assumes that there was a king capital Nokor Phnom. But whether or not really
                    capital existed is here, as for those which become evidence there is no at all.
                    It has several tops, there being a low hill, there is a Buddhism temple in the top vicinity. The
                    road which from the hill extends to the straight line on north probably at one time kingcraft.

                    about 38 kilometers north of Prey Veng provincial town. Chong Srok temple was built of brick and
                    sandstone in the 7th century. It was built on a high ground in a field of palm trees near a koki
                    tree. Although much of the temple has been destroyed, there remains a sandstone statue of a bull,
                    once revered as a powerful Bodhisattva, or a Buddhist deity.

                <p>
                    In the 15th century, the Khmer emperors, under threat from the Siamese (former name of people of
                    current Thailand) decided to resettle back to the east, to Oudong, Lovek then Phnom Penh. Prey Veng
                    did not favor them as it was too close to another danger, namely the Annam. Nevertheless they formed
                    an army at Ba Phnom in 1473 to defend against an invasion of Siam.

                    Under the French protectorate, the colonial authorities saw potential of the region in terms of
                    agriculture and fishing and its proximity to the French colony of Cochin China. Mass deforestation
                    took place, to create land for agriculture.

                    In 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took power, the province experienced its first famine, until 1977.
                    Thousands of people in Prey Veng Province were killed by the Khmer Rouge and buried in mass graves.

                    As the Vietnamese army advanced in January 1979, the region regained its position and became one of
                    the first areas of Cambodia liberated from the Khmer Rouge.

                    Mekong in Cambodia: Neak Loeung/Tsubasa bridge (Neak Loeung/Tsubasa bridge) is a bridge across the
                    Mekong built with Japanese aid and praised by Cambodians as "our Golden Gate Bridge". The
                    construction of this project started on February 14, 2011, with a total budget of 131 million U.S.
                    dollars, with approximately 92 million U.S. dollars in free aid from the Japanese government and
                    more than 2.9 million U.S. dollars from the Cambodian government. The total length of the bridge is
                    2215 meters and the double-ended road connecting the bridge is long. 3100 meters, of which the west
                    bank road is 890 meters long and the east bank road is 2210 meters long, and the road is 14 meters
                    wide. For the moment, the Haliang Bridge will become the longest bridge in Cambodia, 300 meters
                    longer than the 1900-meter bridge in Kuo Kung Province.

                    Ba Phnom District (Khmer: ស្រុកបាភ្នំ sometimes spelled "Ba Phnum") is a district located in Prey
                    Veng Province, in south eastern Cambodia. The hills surrounding the town are the highest elevation
                    points in Prey Veng province. In Khmer, Ba means "ancestor" and Phnom means "hill." When combined,
                    the town is known as "Hill of the Ancestors."

                    Ba Phnom is a relatively remote location and has been attractive to ascenti monks (loak dhutang) for
                    centuries. It has also been an occasional center from which millennial movements have radiated
                    throughout Khmer history.

                    Ba Phnom is a site of interest for Cambodian historians.
