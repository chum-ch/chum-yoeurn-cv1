        <p>
            Ba Phnom District (Khmer: ស្រុកបាភ្នំ sometimes spelled "Ba Phnum") is a district located in Prey Veng Province, in south eastern Cambodia. The hills surrounding the town are the highest elevation points in Prey Veng province. In Khmer, Ba means "ancestor" and Phnom means "hill." When combined, the town is known as "Hill of the Ancestors."

Ba Phnom is a relatively remote location and has been attractive to ascenti monks (loak dhutang) for centuries. It has also been an occasional center from which millennial movements have radiated throughout Khmer history.

Ba Phnom is a site of interest for Cambodian historians.

            Chong Srok temple is located in Chong Srok village, Chong Srok commune, Srei Sithar Kandal district, about 38 kilometers north of Prey Veng provincial town. Chong Srok temple was built of brick and sandstone in the 7th century. It was built on a high ground in a field of palm trees near a koki tree. Although much of the temple has been destroyed, there remains a sandstone statue of a bull, once revered as a powerful Bodhisattva, or a Buddhist deity.

        <span>History of the Prey veng</span>
        <p>
            In the 15th century, the Khmer emperors, under threat from the Siamese (former name of people of current Thailand) decided to resettle back to the east, to Oudong, Lovek then Phnom Penh. Prey Veng did not favor them as it was too close to another danger, namely the Annam. Nevertheless they formed an army at Ba Phnom in 1473 to defend against an invasion of Siam.

Under the French protectorate, the colonial authorities saw potential of the region in terms of agriculture and fishing and its proximity to the French colony of Cochin China. Mass deforestation took place, to create land for agriculture.

In 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took power, the province experienced its first famine, until 1977. Thousands of people in Prey Veng Province were killed by the Khmer Rouge and buried in mass graves.

As the Vietnamese army advanced in January 1979, the region regained its position and became one of the first areas of Cambodia liberated from the Khmer Rouge.
